# Updown.io .NET Client - Environment Variables Example
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# NEVER commit the .env file to version control

# Your Updown.io API key (get it from https://updown.io/settings/edit)
# Used for manual integration tests
UPDOWN_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Your pulse monitoring URL (from Updown.io dashboard)
# Format: https://pulse.updown.io/YOUR-TOKEN/YOUR-KEY
UPDOWN_PULSE_URL=https://pulse.updown.io/your-token/your-key

# Notes:
# - These values are only needed if you want to run manual tests against the real API
# - The automated unit tests do NOT require these values
# - For security, use separate API keys for development/testing vs production
# - This file (.env) is already in .gitignore and will not be committed
